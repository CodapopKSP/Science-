# Science+

Science+ is a plugin for Kerbal Space Program. It provides a lightweight overhaul of the science resource system by adding several new science types and by editing the tech tree to accept these new types.

Science+ is compatible with all science part mods and all planet packs and tech tree mods. Science+ comes pre-packaged with config files for 7 new science types (not compatible with other planet or tech tree mods.)
